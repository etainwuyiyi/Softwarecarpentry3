# Softwarecarpentry3
Attention! This is the most beginner-friendly class SoftwareCarpentry by Doctor Henry and the other two dear TAs.
These fellows are all good people with great patient.
This project asks me to create my own website, which you can see now, and helps me get know GITHUB better.
Although I am still not familiar with git commands so far, I am working on it!
